\section{Allocation of responsibilities}
\label{sect:alloc_responsibilities}

Stefano Formicola is responsible for collecting data during the experiment, writing the sections regarding research questions, method, results, and discussion, and presenting the final project.
Christoph Albert Johns is responsible for creating the test application, writing the abstract and sections regarding introduction and literature study, and presenting the project plan.


\section{Organization}
\label{sect:organization}

The research project will be conducted as a two-person project on the basis of previously published work in the domain of virtual lighting in \gls{AR} scenes and user-based studies.
First, the project's theoretical foundation will be studied in parallel with designing and preparing the test application.
Second, the experiment setup will be decided and prepared. In parallel the test application will be programmed and the basic project presentation will be prepared.
Third, the study participants will be continuously recruited and the required data will be collected and analyzed in parallel.
Fourth, another literature study will be conducted to relate the project's findings to existing work.
Finally, the project presentation will be completed and presented.


\section{Background}
\label{sect:background}
The proposed research project builds on the works in evaluating visual characteristics of \gls{AR} objects in regards to usability (e.g. \cite{gabbard_effects_2006}) and in approximating natural lighting conditions within virtual scenes in augmented reality (e.g. \cite{aittala_inverse_2010}).
Camera-sensor data is used to probe, estimate, and approximate naturalistic virtual lighting that is dynamically added to the objects in a scene \cite{apple_arlightestimate_nodate,apple_pointlight_nodate}.
Depending on the scene and lighting conditions, this can be a computationally intensive process \cite{steed_constructing_2016} and -- depending on the resulting contrast -- lead to improved or worsened object legibility \cite{gabbard_effects_2006}.

There is already research on immersion in digital games -- even in few cases in AR games -- but not on the effects of dynamic lighting.
Proposed methods for dynamic lighting in AR scenes are said to be computationally intensive.

\section{Problem statement}
\label{sect:problem_statement}

The project will investigate whether computationally intensive environment light probing and estimation can be avoided while still achieving comparable levels of immersion in augmented reality scenes.
To achieve naturalistic virtual lighting, video from the AR system's camera feed has to continuously be probed at a high frequency to estimate the environment lighting conditions.
These estimates are required input data for the used shading algorithms.
If users do not notice a difference between scenes with and without automatic naturalistic lighting, these processes can be disabled and the required resources can be freed.
While there have been user-based studies evaluating visual characteristics of \gls{AR} objects, this particular aspect appears not to have been examined yet.

There could be a trade-off between immersion and energy efficiency.

\section{Problem}
\label{sect:problem}

If there is a tradeoff between immersion and energy consumption, avoiding continuous \gls{AR} light estimation could free resources for either alternative uses or extended battery life.
If we find no tradeoff, developers and designers can be responsibly encouraged to implement features that enhance immersion.
That is why we will explore the following questions:

\begin{description}
    \item[RQ1.] Do users perceive a difference in immersion between enabled and disabled automatic naturalistic lighting?
    \item[RQ1a.] If so, are they able to tell that its is caused by the difference in lighting?
    \item[RQ2.] How does enabling automatic naturalistic lighting affect battery consumption?
\end{description}

\section{Hypothesis}
\label{sect:hypothesis}

While we are aware that we will only be able to test the proposed method on a small scale, we hypothesize the following outcomes for a full-scale experiment:

\begin{description}
    \item[H1.] Users experience higher immersion levels when automatic naturalistic lighting is enabled.
    \item[H1a.] Users are able to tell that the lighting was different between both runs of the experiment.
    \item[H2.] Battery consumption levels are higher when automatic naturalistic lighting is enabled.
\end{description}

\section{Purpose}
\label{sect:purpose}

The purpose of this project is to illuminate the relationship between immersion and energy impact in deploying advanced \gls{AR} features, thus empowering developers and designers to decide the most appropriate feature sets for their applications considering both user experience and sustainability aspects.

\section{Goal(s)}
\label{sect:goals}

The goal of this project is to propose and pre-test a method for exploring the relationship described above using a simple example application and an existing \gls{AR} \gls{API}.

\section{Tasks}
\label{sect:tasks}
\todo[inline]{Describe the tasks and sub tasks that are necessary to complete the work. Grouped into a work breakdown structure. For example:}

A simple multicast file server and a corresponding client will be implemented. A number of instances of the client will be executed with different starting times, but starting within \SI{30}{\second} of each other. Our test file will be a file of sufficient size to require more than \SI{30}{\second} to transmit when transported using UDP datagrams via a \SI{10}{Mbps} wired Ethernet. This file will contain a series of pseudo-random bytes. The total number of datagrams transmitted by all of the nodes will be compared when using positive ACK and when only generating NACK. The number of clients will vary from 1 to 1025, in increments of 8 clients.

\section{Method}
\label{sect:method}

The project will use an empirical approach to test two different lighting options in an experiment setting and analyze the results using statistical methods.
More specifically, we will modify an open-source \gls{AR} card-matching game \cite{} to include an option to enable and disable automatic naturalistic lighting using RealityKit's ".disableAREnvironmentLighting" render option.
The sample game will be presented to participants on an Apple iPad in an indoor setting with controlled lighting conditions where participants will be asked to complete one round of the card-matching game for each of the two render options.
The order of render options will be randomized to improve reliability.
The purpose of the experiment will be stated to the participants only in general terms as "investigating immersion in \gls{AR} games" to avoid influencing their perception of the scene by directing their attention towards lighting.
Participants will not be informed about the currently active render option for the same reason.
The sample application has been chosen due to its simplicity in functionality and visual presentation, thereby reducing the risk of errors in use or unwanted effects on immersion due to scene complexity between runs.


During each run, the Apple application "Instruments" \cite{} will be used to log the test device's \gls{CPU} usage and energy impact according to Apple's type definitions \cite{} in three second intervals.
Additionally, the time to completion will be recorded from the moment the participants are handed the test device until the success message appears on screen.
The participants will be encouraged to think aloud \cite{} during their app usage.
After each run, participants will be asked to fill out the \gls{IEQ} (see \ref{sect:ieq}) to measure their levels of immersion dependent on the lighting treatment.
After the second run, participants will additionally be asked about their general experience using the application and elaborate on any differences they noticed between both runs.
If a participant mentions one of the words "light", "lighting", "color", or "contrast" in the think-aloud-protocol or while answering these questions, the difference in lighting is considered as noticed by the user.
The expected duration of the experiment per participant is 30 minutes.
The expected number of participants in the small-scale pre-study of this project is ten.

After the above data has been successfully gathered, we will conduct a statistical analysis regarding the participants' immersion levels and the CPU usage between both lighting conditions using Student's \textit{t}-test \cite{} to check for significant differences.
Additionally, we will report the results of the think-aloud-protocol and interview after the experiment using descriptive statistics.
We are aware, however, that both the results of our analysis of variance as well as the descriptive statistics should not be used to infer knowledge about either the effect of automatic naturalistic lighting on immersion or on energy consumption.
Rather, the analysis is carried out in order to evaluate the chosen methods and to illustrate how such analysis should be done if the same study were carried out on a larger scale.

\section{Milestone chart (time schedule)}
\label{sect:milestones}
\todo[inline]{Give a detailed schedule of how the project will be carried out. What is the project timeline and when will particularly meaningful points, referred to as milestones, be completed? What is the deliverable for each of these milestones? For example:}

The project will start on 25 August and end at 00:00 on 30 August. There will be the following milestones and deliverables:

\begin{description}
\item{26 August} working multicast server and client

\item{27 August} prepare testbed and perform experimental runs for each of the
  different numbers of clients to be completed (as per above) and stored in
  two comma separated files (ACK.csv and NACK.csv) which each line consisting
  of: number of clients, number of packets. Data will be collected using a
  separate computer running Wireshark. Analysis of the data and development of
  the analytic model will proceed in parallel with the data collection.

\item{28 August} model completed based upon using the statistical package R to do the curve fitting to the experimental data

\item{29 August} evaluation of model for additional data points to be check by new experimental runs to check that the model accurately produces the expected number of packets for the given number of clients for both ACK and NACK alternatives.

\item{Before 30 August} submit final report (the report will have been written in parallel with each of the above steps)
