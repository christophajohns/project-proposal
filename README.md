# II2202 Research Methodology and Scientific Writing Project (2020)
## About the course
The aim of the course is to give the students the theoretical and practical skills to plan, conduct, analyze and present, orally and in written form, a scientific assignment in the area of information and communication technology and to give insight and understanding of research methodology, ethics and sustainability.

The course is divided into three parts where the parts are integrated in a final project. The three parts are:
* research methodology
* scientific writing
* scientific assignments

These three parts are examined by a project plan, a method description and a scientific report, as well as an opposition report.

## Authors
The project has been carried out by Christoph Albert Johns and [Stefano Formicola](https://github.com/ste7en).

## Topic
This research aims at illuminating the relationship between immersion and energy impact in deploying advanced augmented reality (AR) features, thus empowering developers and designers to decide the most appropriate feature sets for their applications considering both user experience and sustainability aspects.
