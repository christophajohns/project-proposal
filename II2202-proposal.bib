	abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) interfaces have been studied extensively over the last few decades, with a growing number of user-based experiments. In this paper, we systematically review ten years of the most influential AR user studies, from 2005 to 2014. A total of 291 papers with 369 individual user studies have been reviewed and classified based on their application areas. The primary contribution of the review is to present the broad landscape of user-based AR research, and to provide a high-level view of how that landscape has changed. We summarize the high-level contributions from each category of papers, and present examples of the most influential user studies. We also identify areas where there have been few user studies, and opportunities for future research. Among other things, we find that there is a growing trend towards handheld AR user studies, and that most studies are conducted in laboratory settings and do not involve pilot testing. This research will be useful for AR researchers who want to follow best practices in designing their own AR user studies.},

Starting with a total of 6071 publications we filtered the articles in several steps which resulted in 165 AR related publications with user evaluations. These publications were classified in two different ways: according to the evaluation type used following an earlier literature survey classification scheme; and according to the evaluation methods or approach used. We present the results of out literature survey, provide a comprehensive list of references of the selected publications, and discuss some possible research opportunities for future work.},

The framework also supports the use of more complex light source representations. Once the lighting conditions are solved, we render the image using modern real-time rendering methods such as shadow maps with variable softness, ambient occlusion, advanced BRDF’s and approximate reflections and refractions. Finally, we perform post-processing on the resulting images in order to match the various aberrations and defects typically found in the underlying real-world video.},

We present a pilot study and a follow-on user-based study that examined the effects on user performance of outdoor background textures, changing outdoor illuminance values, and text drawing styles in a text identification task using an optical, see-through AR system. We report significant effects for all these variables, and discuss user interface design guidelines and ideas for future work.},

	abstract = {In this paper we introduce CityViewAR, a mobile outdoor Augmented Reality (AR) application for providing AR information visualization on a city scale. The CityViewAR application was developed to provide geographical information about the city of Christchurch, which was hit by several major earthquakes in 2010 and 2011. The application provides information about destroyed buildings and historical sites that were affected by the earthquakes. The geo-located content is provided in a number of formats including 2D map views, AR visualization of 3D models of buildings on-site, immersive panorama photographs, and list views. The paper describes the iterative design and implementation details of the application, and gives one of the first examples of a study comparing user response to AR and non-AR viewing in a mobile tourism application. Results show that making such information easily accessible to the public in a number of formats could help people to have richer experience about cities. We provide guidelines that will be useful for people developing mobile AR applications for city-scale tourism or outdoor guiding, and discuss how the underlying technology could be used for applications in other areas.},

The game is intended to provide leisure and fun and is played with four players on an augmented tabletop. It evolved from existing games and rules that are popular and familiar amongst senior citizens. Several aspects that are part of the gaming experience, such as immersion, flow, affect and, challenge, were assessed experimentally. The gaming experience was measured relatively by subjectively comparing user reactions across two sessions, one using a conventional board game and another using a digital tabletop version of the same game. Our results indicate that senior citizens found the tabletop version of the game to be more immersive and absorbing. We also discuss some implications to tabletop game design that can be deduced from the qualitative feedback provided by our participants.},

A common way to directly measure players' reported experiences is through questionnaires. However, the large number of questionnaires currently in use introduces several challenges both in terms of selecting suitable measures and comparing results across studies. In this paper, we review some of the most widely known and used questionnaires and focus on the immersive experience questionnaire (IEQ), the game engagement questionnaire (GEQ), and the player experience of need satisfaction (PENS), with the aim to position each of them in relation to each other. This was done through an online survey, in which we gathered 270 responses from players about their most recent experience of a digital game. Our findings show considerable convergence between these three questionnaires and that there is room to refine them into a more widely applicable measure of general game engagement.},

A large number of player experience questionnaires are available, but in most cases empirical validation of the scales is limited or absent. Two of the most commonly used scales are the Player Experience of Need Satisfaction (PENS) and the Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ). Both scales were developed using a rational-theoretical approach, but neither scale has had formal factor-analytic studies published, limiting our capacity to judge the empirical validity of the scales. We present detailed exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of both scales based on responses from a sample (n = 571) of videogame players. The GEQ is partially supported (using a revised factor structure); the PENS is largely supported (with a more minor revision of the factor structure). We provide suggestions for the most effective use of both scales in future research.},

Besides inconsistent reporting of psychometric properties, we found that misleading citation practices with regards to the source, rationale and number of items reported were prevalent, which in part seem to stem from confusion over the "manuscript in preparation" status. Additionally, we present the results of a validation study (N = 633), which found no evidence for the originally postulated 7-factor structure of the GEQ. Based on these findings, we discuss the challenges inherent to the "manuscript in preparation" status and provide recommendations for authors, researchers, educators, and reviewers on how to improve reporting, citation and publication practices.},

The first experiment investigated participants’ abilities to switch from an immersive to a non-immersive task. The second experiment investigated whether there were changes in participants’ eye movements during an immersive task. The third experiment investigated the effect of an externally imposed pace of interaction on immersion and affective measures (state anxiety, positive affect, negative affect). Overall the findings suggest that immersion can be measured subjectively (through questionnaires) as well as objectively (task completion time, eye movements). Furthermore, immersion is not only viewed as a positive experience: negative emotions and uneasiness (i.e. anxiety) also run high.},

	abstract = {Location-aware Augmented Reality (AR) applications are often argued to provide users with immersive experiences that are situated in the real world. Immersion, which can be seen as a form of cognitive and emotional absorption, has been asserted to promote enjoyment, engagement in a task and even learning. However, such claims remain largely unsubstantiated due to the lack of validated instruments for measuring users’ immersion in location-based AR environments. Attempts to develop validated instruments for evaluating immersion have been few and non-systematic, while existing instruments are oriented towards measuring immersion in the context of non-AR digital games. At the same time, studies seeking to operationalize and measure immersion are still inconclusive; even though immersion is considered as a multi-level psychological construct, it is not yet clear whether there is multidimensionality in each level or not. The present study describes the development and validation of the ARI [Augmented Reality Immersion] questionnaire: an instrument for measuring immersion in AR location-aware settings. To achieve this goal, a multi-step process was employed to develop and validate a novel instrument; analyses included exploratory factor analysis with 202 high school students, followed by a confirmatory factor analysis with 162 high school students. This multi-step process resulted in a 21-item, seven-point Likert-type instrument with satisfactory construct validity, which is based on a multi-leveled model of immersion with multidimensionality in each level. We argue that the ARI questionnaire, as a validated and tested measurement, can be highly useful for researchers and designers in the field of location-based AR.},

Factors believed to underlie presence were described in the premier issue of Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments. We used these factors and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive tendencies questionnaire (ITQ) to measure differences in the tendencies of individuals to experience presence. These questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among reported presence and other research variables. Combined results from four experiments lead to the following conclusions:  the PQ and ITQ are internally consistent measures with high reliability; there is a weak but consistent positive relation between presence and task performance in VEs; individual tendencies as measured by the ITQ predict presence as measured by the PQ; and individuals who report more simulator sickness symptoms in VE report less presence than those who report fewer symptoms.},

	abstract = {Since their introduction over 40 years ago, digital entertainment games have become one of the most popular leisure activities globally. While digital games clearly provide highly engaging activities, the nature of this engagement is not well understood. The current study aims to advance our understanding by reporting a systematic review of recent literature addressing engagement in computer games. The papers in the review comprise a sub-sample of papers relating to engagement in digital games that was selected from a broader literature search carried out on the outcomes and impacts of playing computer games. A diverse range of studies was identified that examined varied aspects of engagement in games including subjective experiences while playing games, the physiological concomitants of these experiences, motives for playing games, game usage and time spent playing games and the impact of playing on life satisfaction. A narrative review was carried out to capture these diverse aspects of engagement and to develop a more coherent understanding of engagement in computer games.},

	abstract = {Researchers occasionally have to work with an extremely small sample size, defined herein as N â‰¤ 5. Some methodologists have cautioned against using the t-test when the sample size is extremely small, whereas others have suggested that using the t-test is feasible in such a case. The present simulation study estimated the Type I error rate and statistical power of the one- and two-sample t-tests for normally distributed populations and for various distortions such as unequal sample sizes, unequal variances, the combination of unequal sample sizes and unequal variances, and a lognormal population distribution. Ns per group were varied between 2 and 5. Results show that the t-test provides Type I error rates close to the 5\% nominal value in most of the cases, and that acceptable power (i.e., 80\%) is reached only if the effect size is very large. ... Compared to the regular t-test, the Welch test tends to reduce statistical power and the t-testR yields false positive rates that deviate from 5\%. This study further shows that a paired t-test is feasible with extremely small Ns if the within-pair correlation is high. It is concluded that there are no principal.objections to using a t-test with Ns as small as 2. A final cautionary note is made on the credibility of research findings when sample sizes are small.

	abstract = {Immersion is a phenomenon experienced whilst playing digital games. Some argue that it is linked to time perception, where gamers claim that they are losing track of time while they are immersed in the game. In this work in progress, we describe an attempt to investigate the relationship between immersion and time perception. We manipulated attention because it is known to inﬂuence immersion and time perception diﬀerently. The results suggest that the experimental manipulation only aﬀects time perception but not immersion. We therefore argue that there is a dissociation between immersion and time perception but further work is needed to investigate this in detail.},
