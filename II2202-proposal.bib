	abstract = {We present a practical and robust photorealistic rendering pipeline for augmented reality. We solve the real world lighting conditions from observations of a diffuse sphere or a rotated marker. The solution method is based on l1-regularized least squares minimization, yielding a sparse set of light sources readily usable with most rendering methods. The framework also supports the use of more complex light source representations. Once the lighting conditions are solved, we render the image using modern real-time rendering methods such as shadow maps with variable softness, ambient occlusion, advanced BRDFâ€™s and approximate reflections and refractions. Finally, we perform post-processing on the resulting images in order to match the various aberrations and defects typically found in the underlying real-world video.},

	abstract = {Abstract A challenge in presenting augmenting information in outdoor augmented reality (AR) settings lies in the broad range of uncontrollable environmental conditions that may be present, specifically large-scale fluctuations in natural lighting and wide variations in likely backgrounds or objects in the scene. In this paper, we motivate the need for research on the effects of text drawing styles, outdoor background textures, and natural lighting on user performance in outdoor AR. We present a pilot study and a follow-on user-based study that examined the effects on user performance of outdoor background textures, changing outdoor illuminance values, and text drawing styles in a text identification task using an optical, see-through AR system. We report significant effects for all these variables, and discuss user interface design guidelines and ideas for future work.},
